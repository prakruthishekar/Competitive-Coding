# An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], 
# where (x1, y1) is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) is the 
# coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, 
# and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.

# Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. 
# To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

# Given two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they overlap, 
# otherwise return false.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
# Output: false
