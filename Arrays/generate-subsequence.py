# A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by removing zero or
#  more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
# For the same example, there are 15 sub-sequences. 
# They are (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (1,3),(1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (1,2,3), 
# (1,2,4), (1,3,4), (2,3,4),(1,2,3,4). 
# More generally, we can say that for a sequence of size n, we can have (2n-1)non-empty 
# sub-sequences in total.
