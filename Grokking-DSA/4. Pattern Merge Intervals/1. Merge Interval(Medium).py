# Problem Statement #
# Given a list of intervals, merge all the overlapping intervals to produce a list that has 
# only mutually exclusive intervals.

# Example 1:

# Intervals: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
# Output: [[1,5], [7,9]]
# Explanation: Since the first two intervals [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we merged them into 
# one [1,5].

# Example 2:

# Intervals: [[6,7], [2,4], [5,9]]
# Output: [[2,4], [5,9]]
# Explanation: Since the intervals [6,7] and [5,9] overlap, we merged them into one [5,9].
 
# Example 3:

# Intervals: [[1,4], [2,6], [3,5]]
# Output: [[1,6]]
# Explanation: Since all the given intervals overlap, we merged them into one.
 


def merge(intervals):
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x[0])
        merged =[]
        for i in intervals:
			# if the list of merged intervals is empty 
			# or if the current interval does not overlap with the previous,
			# simply append it.
            if not merged or merged[-1][-1] < i[0]:
                merged.append(i)
                # print(merged[-1])
                # print(merged[-1][-1])
			# otherwise, there is overlap,
			#so we merge the current and previous intervals.
            else:
                merged[-1][-1] = max(merged[-1][-1], i[-1])
        return merged


# Time: O(NlogN) - sorting
# Space: O(N) - sorting in Python
print(merge([[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]))  
print(merge([[1,4],[4,5]]))
